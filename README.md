# 2019 Hurricane Tracker
Welcome to the Hurricane Tracking GUI which works out of an IPython Notebook. This notebook accesses data from the National Hurricane Center's archive of storm data from 1851-2019. To use this package, download the entire repository and open up in jupyter notebook. The storms tracks can be annimated to iterate through different points in the tracks highlighting different models projections. This is intended for scientific and fun uses and was inspired by a 2014 version of this application created by Florita Rodriguez. Thanks, and enjoy!
